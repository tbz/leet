This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Want to add a language?

Cool! Create an issue using the language template: https://github.com/tbz/leet/issues/new/choose
I'll add the language as soon as I can.

If you want to do it yourself, add the languages to the list in `src/i18n.ts` (it is sorted by ISO language code) and the translations in `src/messages.json`.  
Create a PR in this repo and I'll take a look at it.
